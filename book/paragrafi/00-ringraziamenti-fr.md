# Acknowledgments

We are deeply grateful to our families, whose love and unwavering support have made this project possible. Without their patience, understanding, and encouragement, reaching this milestone would not have been achievable.

A special thank you also goes to our friends and colleagues who have supported us along the way, offering valuable advice, constructive criticism, and shared moments that have enriched our work.

Finally, we want to express our gratitude to everyone who, directly or indirectly, contributed to the creation of this book. Every word, every page, is the result of collective effort and shared passion.

*"Gratitude is not only the memory of the heart but also the light that illuminates the path ahead."* â€“ Anonymous

Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
