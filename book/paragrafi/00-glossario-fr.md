- **Algorithmic Bias**
  A systematic error in the results of an AI model, caused by biases in the training data.
  **Example**: A recruitment system that favors a specific gender due to skewed historical data.

- **Big Data**
  Large volumes of data, often too complex to be handled with traditional tools, used to train AI models.
  **Example**: A company analyzing millions of transactions a day to predict purchasing trends.

## **C**

- **Chatbot**
  A program that simulates a conversation with humans, often used for customer support.
  **Example**: A chatbot on an e-commerce site that helps customers find products.

- **Clustering**
  An unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data into clusters.
  **Example**: An algorithm that groups a company's customers based on their purchasing behavior.

- **Cross-Validation**
  A technique for evaluating Machine Learning models by dividing the dataset into multiple parts to ensure the model generalizes well.
  **Example**: A weather prediction model tested on different parts of the dataset.

---

## **D**

- **Dataset**
  A collection of structured data, often used to train Machine Learning models.
  **Example**: A dataset of images of dogs and cats used to train a recognition model.

- **Deepfake**
  A technique that uses AI to create fake but realistic videos or images.

## **I**

- **Inference**
  The phase where a trained AI model is used to make predictions or decisions on new data.
  **Example**: An image recognition model identifying a cat in a new photo.

- **Interpretability**
  The ability of an AI system to explain its decisions in a way that is understandable to humans.
  **Example**: A medical diagnosis system explaining why it classified an image as a "benign tumor."

---

## **L**

- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**
  A technique for explaining the predictions of complex AI models by showing which data features influenced the decision.
  **Example**: A model classifying images and showing that it looked at the ears and nose to decide if an image represents a cat.

---

## **M**

- **Machine Learning**
  See **Apprendimento Automatico**.

- **Modal Collapse**
  A problem that occurs during the training of GANs, where the generator always produces the same output.
  **Example**: A GAN that always generates the same image of a face.

---

## **N**

- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**
  A field of AI that deals with the interaction between machines and human language.
  **Example**: Google Translate, which translates text from one language to another.

---

## **O**

- **Overfitting**
  A problem that occurs when a Machine Learning model learns the training data too well, losing the ability to generalize to new data.
  **Example**: A model that perfectly recognizes faces in the training dataset but fails with new faces.

---

## **P**

- **Prompt**
  A request or instruction given to an AI to generate a specific output.
  **Example**: "Write a poem about autumn" is a prompt for a text-generating AI.
