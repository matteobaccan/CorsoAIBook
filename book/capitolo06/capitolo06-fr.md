#### **6.5.2 Autonomous Driving**

Autonomous vehicles use AI to perceive their surroundings, make decisions, and navigate safely without human intervention. Computer vision models, such as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, are used to identify objects, road signs, and pedestrians, while planning algorithms determine the optimal route.

### **6.6 Facial and Voice Recognition**

#### **6.6.1 Facial Recognition**

Facial recognition is used in many applications, from unlocking smartphones to public surveillance. Systems like Apple's **Face ID** and Facebook's **DeepFace** use AI algorithms to accurately identify faces. This technology is also used in security contexts, such as access control and suspect identification.

#### **6.6.2 Voice Recognition**

Voice recognition is used to convert speech into text, enabling natural interaction with electronic devices. Applications like **Siri**, **Alexa**, and **Google Assistant** use voice recognition algorithms to understand and respond to user requests. This technology is also used in professional contexts, such as meeting transcription and document dictation.

### **6.7 Handwriting Recognition**

#### **6.7.1 Document Digitization**

AI is used to recognize and digitize handwriting, making it easier to store and search documents. Applications like **Google Translate** can recognize and translate handwritten text in real-time, improving accessibility and communication.

#### **6.7.2 Authentication**

Handwriting recognition is used for biometric authentication, allowing verification of a person's identity based on their handwriting. This technology is used in security contexts, such as digital signatures and access control.

### **6.8 Intelligent Robots**
