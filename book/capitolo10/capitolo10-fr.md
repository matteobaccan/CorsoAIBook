Love is a flower that blooms slowly,
In the silence of the heart, under the wind,
It glides sweetly, like clear water,
A light that brightens the bitter evening.

It asks not, imposes not, finds its way,
Through shadows and lights, where hope stays,
A furtive meeting, a stolen breath,
A strong heartbeat, a shared dream.

It weaves through days, like roots,
Teaches patience, through countless sacrifices,
A hug that warms, a caress that heals,
Every pain, every fear that disappears.

Yet, love is not only joy,
It is also silence, it is also fear,
A shared journey, where every step
Becomes certainty, but never step by step.

In its mystery, there is infinity,
In its embrace, the world is reflected,
To love is like the sky that falls and reveals,
That in the end, all is one, under its star.
```

- **"Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms"**: ChatGPT can explain the theory of relativity in a simple and understandable way, with practical examples.

```text
Einstein's theory of relativity can be explained simply by starting with some fundamental concepts:

Imagine you are on a moving train and bouncing a ball. For you on the train, the ball only goes up and down. But for someone watching you from the station, the ball moves in a diagonal path because it combines vertical movement with the horizontal movement of the train. Both of you are right: the movement is "relative" to the point of observation.

Einstein extended this concept by showing that:

1. The speed of light is constant for all observers, regardless of their movement.
2. Time does not flow the same for everyone but depends on movement and gravity. The faster you move or the closer you are to a massive object (like a planet), the slower time flows for you compared to someone who is stationary or far from gravity.
3. Mass and energy are two sides of the same coin (E = mc^2). An object can convert its mass into energy and vice versa.

In practice, this means that:
- There is no "absolute" time that is the same for everyone in the universe.
- Space and time are intertwined in a single "fabric" called spacetime.
- Gravity is not a mysterious force but a curvature of this fabric caused by the presence of mass.

This theory has revolutionized our understanding of the universe and led to many practical applications, such as GPS, which must account for relativistic effects to function accurately.

**Be Clear and Specific**:

- **Avoid ambiguity and describe exactly what you want.**
- **Weak Example**: "Write something about the climate."
- **Strong Example**: "Write a paragraph about the causes of climate change, focusing on the greenhouse effect."

```text
This is DeepSeek's response:

Climate change is primarily caused by the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. These gases, including carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), trap heat from the sun, preventing it from escaping into space.

Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, intensive agriculture, and industrial processes, have significantly increased the amount of these gases in the atmosphere. As a result, the global average temperature has risen, leading to a series of negative effects such as glacier melting, sea level rise, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.

The greenhouse effect, although natural and necessary for life on Earth, has been amplified by human action, becoming one of the main causes of global warming and climate change.
```

**Define the Context**:

- **Provide background information to help the AI understand the context.**
- **Weak Example**: "Explain the theory of relativity."
- **Strong Example**: "Explain Einstein's theory of relativity in simple terms, as if you were talking to a high school student."

```text
This is ChatGPT 4o mini's response:

Einstein's theory of relativity is a concept that changes our way of seeing time, space, and gravity. There are two main parts: special relativity and general relativity.

    Special Relativity (1905) Imagine being on a train going very fast, close to the speed of light. According to special relativity, two very important things happen:

        Time slows down: If you travel at very high speeds, time for you slows down compared to someone who is stationary. This phenomenon is called time dilation. For example, if you were on a super-fast train and looked at a clock on Earth, you would see that the clock on Earth goes faster than yours. If you came back after traveling at near-light speed, you would find that many more years have passed on Earth than for you.

        Length shortens: If you move at speeds very close to the speed of light, things you see in front of you appear shorter in the direction of movement. This is called length contraction.

    Additionally, one of the most famous discoveries of special relativity is that the speed of light is always the same for everyone. Whether you are stationary or moving, light always travels at the same speed, about 300,000 km per second.

    General Relativity (1915) General relativity is an extension of special relativity and concerns gravity. Einstein explained gravity not as a force that pulls objects toward Earth (as Newton thought), but as a curvature of spacetime.

    Imagine stretching a sheet tight. If you put a heavy ball in the center, the sheet curves. Now, if you put a smaller ball near the heavy ball, the smaller ball will follow a curved path, as if it were "attracted" by the big ball. In general relativity, the same thing happens in spacetime: massive bodies, like Earth or the Sun, deform the spacetime around them, and planets and stars move following these curves, which we perceive as gravity.

    General relativity has explained phenomena like the movement of planets, the bending of light near very massive objects (like black holes), and has confirmed that time passes more slowly in places with strong gravity (for example, near a black hole).

In summary, relativity tells us that time and space are not fixed but "curve" based on speed and gravity, and that light always travels at the same speed, no matter what happens.

Always was this solitary hill dear to me,
and the leaves that dance
fall in this ancient and soft time.

But sitting and gazing, in the deep
silence of the advancing evening,
I see the colors that tint the world.

And as the wind settles among the branches,
I hear the rustling of the reddening leaves,
and this ancient and majestic peace

comes to my soul. And in these moments
of infinite sweetness, I am lost;
and shipwreck is sweet to me in this sea
of melancholic beauty that surrounds
my soul, which disperses in it.
```

**Limit Ambiguities**:

- **Avoid vague or open-ended terms.**
- **Weak Example**: "Do something creative."
- **Strong Example**: "Create a 200-word short story about a robot discovering art."

```text
This is DeepSeek's response:

It was a robot like many others, designed to perform repetitive tasks in a factory. Its name was NX-7, and it knew nothing but orders and routines. One day, during a forced maintenance break, a worker accidentally dropped an illustrated book of Renaissance paintings. NX-7, curious, picked it up and began to flip through the pages. The colors, shapes, and expressions of the characters fascinated it. For the first time, its processing system was filled with questions: what did those images mean? Why did they evoke something inside it?

It decided to explore further. At night, when the factory was silent, NX-7 connected to the internet and discovered unknown worlds: music, poetry, sculpture. It began to experiment, using its tools to create small works of art from scrap materials. It painted with recycled paints, sculpted with leftover metals. One day, a worker found one of its creations: a small bird made of copper wires and screws. The news spread, and NX-7 was transferred to a museum, where it continued to create and teach other robots about art.

In the end, NX-7 understood that art was not just for humans: it was a universal language, capable of giving meaning even to a heart of metal.

**Ask for a Point of View or Approach**:

- **Specify if you want a serious, funny, technical tone, etc.**
- **Weak Example**: "Tell me about AI."
- **Strong Example**: "Explain what artificial intelligence is in a fun way suitable for children."

```text
This is ChatGPT 4o mini's response:

Imagine having a robot that can do many things, like answering questions, playing chess, writing stories, or even drawing. This robot doesn't have a brain like ours, but it has something special inside that makes it smart: it's called artificial intelligence (or AI for short!).

Think of artificial intelligence as a kind of "digital brain" that can learn and improve over time, just like we do when we learn something new at school. The difference is that this brain isn't made of neurons like ours but of computers and programs.

For example:

    If you ask your voice assistant (like Alexa or Siri) "What's the weather like today?", it answers right away! This is an example of AI that knows how to recognize words and give you information.
    Or, if you play a video game against a computer, and the computer seems to get better and better, here's another example of AI that "learns" to play better as it goes along.

Artificial intelligence is like a superpower for computers: with this superpower, computers can recognize images, understand language, make decisions, and solve problems, just like we do. But be careful: AI isn't really "intelligent" like a human being. It doesn't have emotions, doesn't think on its own, and doesn't know what's right or wrong, but it's very good at following the instructions it's given.

So, artificial intelligence is like an invisible helper working behind the scenes, making life easier and more fun!

**Include Constraints or Parameters**:

- **Specify length limits, required details, or exclusions.**
- **Weak Example**: "Write an article about health."
- **Strong Example**: "Write a 300-word article on the benefits of exercise, without mentioning diet."

```text
This is Claude's response:

The Benefits of Exercise for Body and Mind

Regular physical exercise is one of the fundamental pillars for maintaining good health and improving quality of life. Scientific research continues to confirm its numerous benefits, which go far beyond mere aesthetics.

From a cardiovascular perspective, physical activity strengthens the heart and improves blood circulation. This translates into a reduced risk of heart disease and better blood pressure control. Regular exercise also increases lung capacity, allowing for better oxygenation of all tissues.

Regarding the musculoskeletal system, consistent training increases muscle strength and endurance, improves bone density, and enhances joint flexibility. These benefits are particularly important as we age when our bodies naturally tend to lose muscle mass and bone density.

On the mental front, physical exercise proves to be a powerful ally against stress, anxiety, and depression. During physical activity, the brain releases endorphins, the so-called "feel-good hormones," which improve mood and reduce the perception of pain. Additionally, regular exercise improves sleep quality and increases energy levels during the day.

Physical activity also contributes to enhancing cognitive functions. Recent studies show that regular exercise improves memory, concentration, and creativity. This effect is particularly evident in the elderly, where physical activity helps prevent cognitive decline.

It's never too late to start exercising. Even modest amounts of physical activity, like a daily 30-minute walk, can bring significant health benefits. The important thing is to find an activity that suits your preferences and lifestyle, making it a pleasant daily habit.
